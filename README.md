# Hi, I'm Cooper Baugh! 👋
🎮 Game Developer | 🤖 AI Enthusiast | 📚 Driven Student 

I'm Cooper Baugh, a second-year computer science student at The University of Colorado, Boulder. While my journey into computer science began as a 
class requirement, I quickly discovered my passion for problem-solving, coding, and the versatility of the field. With a foundation in C++, I’ve become particularly 
interested in game development and the user experience. I’m always eager to learn and grow, continuously seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge. 
I enjoy rock climbing, cinema, and animation.

## 🛠️ Skills
- **Languages:** C#, C++, JavaScript, HTML
- **Game Development:** Unity, Aesprite, Asset Management, Seeded Randomness
- **AI/Algorithms:** Behavior Trees, Pathfinding, Procedural Generation, State Machines
- **Tools:** Docker, Git, Visual Studio

## 🚀 Featured Projects
- [A* Algorithm](https://github.com/Cimmerial/A-Star.git): A modified implementation of the A* algorithm, featuring customizable heuristics and dynamic path adjustments.
- [BehaviorTree](https://github.com/Cimmerial/BehaviorTree.git): A scalable behavior tree framework that simplifies managing complex decision-making logic, ideal for AI in games.
- [Elevate or Asphyxiate](https://github.com/Cimmerial/ElevateOrAsphyxiate.git): A challenging arcade-style survival game made for the annual Interstellar game jam with the Unity framework.
- [BlackWinter-Public](https://github.com/Cimmerial/BlackWinter-Public.git): The public branch of **Black Winter**, a game currently deep in development.

## 📂 Earlier Projects
- [Memory Card Game](https://github.com/Cimmerial/Memory.git): A simulated memory focused card game which can be played in the terminal.
- [The Odyssey](https://github.com/Cimmerial/TheOdyssey.git): A two player adventure game which involves decision making and random events.

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
- **Advanced Procedural Generation:** Delving into algorithms that create expansive, random room configurations using "controlled randomness".
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL):** Understanding the techniques that enable AI to learn through trial and error, and how these techniques are improving.
- **Disney's "12 Principles of Animation":** Exploring the concepts from *The Illusion of Life* (1981) to further understand animation and how certain techniques can influence human perception.
